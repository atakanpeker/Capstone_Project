## Cyclistic Project

This is my Capstone project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. 
This program gave me a data about a fictional company called "Cyclistic". 
It is a bike-share company that has casual riders and annual members.
My business task is to analyse previous 12 months of bike trip data of Cyclistic and identify trends to answer how annual members and casual riders differ.

This project includes the R file, R markdown file, github document, and two graph images.

* Using Tidyverse, Lubridate, ggplot2 packages.
* Adding new columns to the data frame such as average length of the trip durations called "ride_length" and "day_of_week" which is the day of the week riders used the bicycle.
* Including data of how many times people used this service as "number_of_rides".
* The analysis is based on how members and casual riders differ in terms of "ride_length", "day_of_week", and "number_of_rides".
* This report identified a trend according to being a member or casual and found differences with respect to day of the week such as weekday or in the weekend.

# Cyclistic Project

This is my Capstone project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. 
This program gave me a data about a fictional company called "Cyclistic". 
It is a bike-share company that has casual riders and annual members.
My business task is to analyse previous 12 months of bike trip data of Cyclistic and identify trends to answer how annual members and casual riders differ.

This project includes the R file, R markdown file, github document, and two graph images.
